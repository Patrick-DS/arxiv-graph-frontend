# ArXiv graph

This is a prototype to develop a graph-based (in the sense of graph theory) visualizer for math books, articles and arguments in general. It would eventually expand and become a navigable encyclopedia. The first iteration would focus on known theories and once it kicks in popularity, try to find ways to automate and scale the process of expanding the "mathematical map" (which we call the ArXiv Graph).
